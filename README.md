Breakout Java GUI.  Basic Breakout.  You are able to shoot with the paddle, but you have a maximum of 5 bullets on screen at all times.
the bricks however get closer and closer as the game goes on.  The original source code has been lost, however I was able to decompile
the jar and get some code back, but is missing some features from the original.  
GameDriver and SoundDriver classes were made by Jonathan Gonzales
